# [quiznot](https://cabalex.github.io/quiznot)
A web app that makes term memorization fun! Created by a team of three (including me) for the [Congressional App Challenge 2021](https://www.congressionalappchallenge.us/).

[Note that this version is a **hosted version** using GitHub Pages](https://cabalex.github.io/quiznot), and that the original repository is private (hence, all the commits here are by me). You are free to fork and add your own games, however!
